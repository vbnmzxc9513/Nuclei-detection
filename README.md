# NVRDL2019FALL Data Science Bowl 2018

This is a project of implement instance segementation on data science bowl challenge with with 1349 labeled image and 100 tested image.
We had implement the task base on following backbone modules:
1. Detectron2, from https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2 or https://github.com/conansherry/detectron2 for windows build

The code We  had written were 
1. To_Cocoformat_and_moveImg.ipynb https://github.com/vbnmzxc9513/Nuclei-detection/blob/master/To_Cocoformat_and_moveImg.ipynb
and 
2. train_Cascade.py https://github.com/vbnmzxc9513/Nuclei-detection/blob/master/train_Cascade.py

3. submission_and_visualize.ipynb https://github.com/vbnmzxc9513/Nuclei-detection/blob/master/submission_and_visualize.ipynb
Both of these file were start modify from detectron2's colab notebook https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16jcaJoc6bCFAQ96jDe2HwtXj7BMD_-m5
